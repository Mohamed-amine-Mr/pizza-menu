# Pizza Menu App

## Description
This is a simple React application that displays a pizza menu. It demonstrates key React concepts such as component-based architecture, props, conditional rendering, and mapping over arrays to generate UI elements dynamically. The project is structured to help users understand how React manages data and components.

## Features
- **Component-based structure:** The app is divided into `Header`, `Menu`, `Footer`, and `Pizza` components.
- **Props and data passing:** The `Pizza` component receives a pizza object as a prop to dynamically render information.
- **Conditional rendering:** If no pizza data is available, a fallback message is displayed.
- **Dynamic UI:** The menu updates automatically based on the data provided.

## What I Learned
This project helped me practice and reinforce my React skills, including:
- Importing and using components
- Managing props to pass data between components
- Using `.map()` to dynamically generate UI elements
- Conditional rendering with JSX
- Applying class-based styling dynamically
